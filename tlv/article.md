Todays article in the firmware 101 series is about TLVs. TLVs are a way to store or organize data. Since i've known about TLVs, i use them in almost every project, becuase of their simplicity and flexibility. In this article i will explain what TLVs are, how they work and how/where to use them.

The first time i've heard about TLV's, was about 2.5 months ago, when i started to work as a fulltime embedded developer. (I firstly confused it with the Windows VLC media player).
TLV stands for **Tag**-**Length**-**Value**. If you illustrate them, they look something like this:

TLV's are just a way to organize data and make it easy to interpret.
